# Nested Prefabs WIP Plan

> MoonHug Editor uses scenes as prefabs so prefab is synonym to scene in thid document.

## Roadmap

- nested prefabs roadmap:
  - [v] scene tree data model
  - [v] serialization: scene tree file with guid in project
  - [v] asset registry: AssetDB
  - [v] instantiate scene tree as child

  - [v] prefab instance record
  - [v] transparent nested scene
  - [v] prefab overrides: nested scene instance overrides

  - [v] deep nested prefabs
  - [v] breadcrumbs — serialized nested-cross-scene references

  - prefab variants

# Design

## Scene File Format

Following Unity's approach, `NestedScene` is **metadata** in the scene file — not a component on a transform. The transform tree only contains non-nested-owned nodes.

```
SceneFile {
  root:              Local_ID
  next_local_id:     Local_ID
  transforms:        []Transform         // only non-nested-owned nodes
  nested_scenes:     []NestedScene       // metadata, analogous to Unity PrefabInstance
  breadcrumbs:       []Breadcrumb        // placeholder anchors for cross-scene refs
  ...components...
}
```

### NestedScene record (metadata)

Analogous to Unity's `PrefabInstance` YAML object:

```
NestedScene {
  local_id:         Local_ID       // file ID of this record
  source_prefab:    Asset_GUID     // GUID of the nested scene asset (m_SourcePrefab)
  transform_parent: Local_ID       // local_id of the parent transform in this file (m_TransformParent)
  sibling_index:    int            // order among siblings
  overrides:        []Override     // property overrides
}
```

`transform_parent == 0` means root — this is how Prefab Variants work in Unity (the base prefab is a `NestedScene` with no parent).

### Breadcrumb record (Analogous to Unity's stripped Transform objects (marked with `stripped` tag))
Breadcrumb  is the serialized form of a cross-scene Handle reference.
  - created in scene file for cross-scene references - different referrer source_prefab vs reference source_prefab.
  - resolved back into a Handle on load.
  - enough data to load the real object **once**, after resolve breadcrumb is dropped and referrers hold a normal local id / handle.


Rules:
- Referencing in file should use local_id only
- When local_id doesn't exist it should be created
- During serialiation cross-scene references are converted into breadcrumbs

```
Breadcrumb {
  local_id:              Local_ID   // local_id referrers will use to refer this element
  scene_source:          PPtr       // asset guid + local_id in that asset of this element
  scene_instance:        Local_ID   // scene instance local_id in this file
}
```

Live scene (post-deserialize):
- Persisted breadcrumbs live only in `SceneFile`
- `Scene.local_ids` maps entity `local_id`s to real pool handles (transforms, components, etc.).
- Resolving a cross-scene reference loads the target if needed, wires the real object, then removes the breadcrumb.

### Override record
Override is modification of nested scene target value saved at root scene level
  - root scene can have overrides for its nested scene references.
  - when nested — overrides are opaque to parent scene(don't exist any more), nested scene has them already applied when created.

```
Override {
  target:        Local_ID   // file ID of the component/transform inside the source prefab
  property_path: string     // dot-separated path e.g. "position.x", "color"
  value:         json.Value // override value
}
```

- Entire array is one atomic override. Never override individual elements. If anything inside the array changes, the whole array is the override value:


## Runtime usage

- bake and diff operations work on Json Value trees for genericness and simplicity

### Instantiating a NestedScene at runtime
- Load source prefab asset by `source_prefab` GUID
- Bake `overrides` on top before deserialization
- Instantiate it as a child of the transform identified by `transform_parent`

### Instantiating a variant prefab
- Bake(Unpack) root and overrides into a single json as if there were no overrides at all
- Cache and use baked JSON to instantiate variant prefab

## Edit time usage

`NestedScene` records live in `SceneFile.nested_scenes`. They are not present in the runtime transform tree directly — at edit time the editor resolves them into live transform nodes (nested_owned), and on save collapses them back to metadata records.

### Overrides

- `NestedScene` holds `overrides` list for self and inner items, except for child `NestedScene`s
  - child `NestedScene`s behave the same way

Serialization triggers baking base and working copy, diffs them to produce overrides written back to the `NestedScene` record.
- UX: overrides grow only — if same value but override exists, keep it
- Removing an override requires explicit UI action (revert)
- diff produces overrides between baked_base and working_copy

### Enter prefab

Enter prefab N:
- baked_base    = bake(chain[0..N-1])
- working_copy  = bake(chain[0..N]) <- user sees and edits this

#### Examples
Enter prefab 0(root):
- baked_base    = bake(chain[0..-1]) <- nothing
- working_copy  = bake(chain[0..0]) <- bakes root(self)

Enter prefab 1(root+variant):
- baked_base    = bake(chain[0..0]) <- baked root
- working_copy  = bake(chain[0..1]) <- bakes root + variant


### Exit prefab
- Save/Discard/Cancel

### Changes propagation
Saving a prefab walks all live `NestedScene` records whose `source_prefab` GUID matches the saved asset and reloads them.

## Extras
- Apply override — writes override back up the chain to the source asset, removes it from the `NestedScene` record.  
- todo

Revert override — discards a specific override on the `NestedScene` record, restoring the field to the baked base value
- defer removes override info, calls cleanup_T on target field then deserializes specific json branch into target field

# Consider Later
## Scene edit stack
- enter inner prefab pushes to scene edit stack
- exit inner prefab pops from scene edit stack

## Prefab isolation mode
- show fully colored prefab in grayed out context
